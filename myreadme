## Read the train data -- train/X_train.txt
## Read the test data -- test/X_test.txt
## Combine the train data and the test data into one 10299x561 data.frame 
## reads the subjects for the train data
## reads the subjects for the test data
## combine the subjects  -- training and subjects -- into a single
## 10299x1 dataframe 
## reads the activity labels for the training data
## reads the activity labels for the test data
## combines the activity labels into a 10299x1 dataframe
## names the activity labels and the subject labels with a descriptive variable
## name
## Get the descriptive activity label names from the activity_labels.txt
## changes the label names to camelCase format
##Read the features file and store it in a 561x2 dataframe
## get the index of the variable labels that contains either "mean()" or "std()"
## from the feature to get the variables that contain measurements of the mean
## and standard deviation resulting in a numeric vector with 66 members.
##subset the full data by the index to get a 10299x66 dataframe
## Select the required labels from the features data.frame by
## subsetting the features dataframe by index
## Cleans up the column names of the subset by removing the "()" and making the 
##  first letter of "mean" and "std" a capital letter "M" and "S" respectively.
##apply the headings as the variable names for the data
## 
## Combine the subset of fulldata "data.full.subset" with the 
##subject label "subject.full" and activity labels "labels.full"
## Apply the activity labels to the activity column
## generate a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
## variable for each activity and each subject.
